## AI Matching Algorithm

### Scoring Components

1. **Exact Skill Matches (80% weight)**
   - Direct matches between candidate skills and job requirements
   - Case-insensitive comparison

2. **Partial Skill Matches (30% weight)**
   - Skills mentioned in resume text but not in extracted skills list
   - Contextual matching within resume content

3. **Experience Level Bonus (+10 points)**
   - Matches experience keywords (senior, lead, manager, etc.)
   - Considers both job description and candidate background

### Match Score Calculation
\`\`\`
Base Score = (Exact Matches / Total Required Skills) √ó 80 + 
             (Partial Matches / Total Required Skills) √ó 30

Final Score = Base Score + Experience Bonus (capped at 100%)
\`\`\`

### Visual Indicators
- **Green (80-100%)**: Excellent match
- **Yellow (60-79%)**: Good match  
- **Red (0-59%)**: Poor match

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- \`POST /api/auth/login\` - User login
- \`POST /api/auth/signup\` - User registration

### Jobs
- \`GET /api/jobs\` - List all jobs
- \`POST /api/jobs\` - Create new job
